# Repository Guidelines

> **项目名称**：本仓对 AI 操作者而言称为 **DashBox** —— 基于 DramaClaw CE（Elastic License 2.0，上游仓库 <https://github.com/dramaclaw/dramaclaw>）的本地化二次开发版本。下文中的 SuperTale / novelvideo 为上游保留标识，请勿改动。

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository contains the SuperTale Community Edition backend and video pipeline. Python source lives under `src/novelvideo/`, with major areas such as `api/` for FastAPI routes, `task_backend/` for job execution, `generators/` for media generation, `verification/` for quality gates, `ports/` for interface boundaries, and `assets/` for bundled media. Tests live in `tests/`, with contract tests in `tests/contract/` and port-focused tests in `tests/ports/`. Operational scripts are in `scripts/`, documentation in `docs/`, examples in `examples/`, and compliance artifacts in `docs/compliance/`, `LICENSES/`, and `sbom.spdx.json`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `uv sync --group dev`: install runtime and development dependencies from `uv.lock`.
- `uv run novelvideo api --port 8780`: start the local REST API.
- `uv run pytest`: run the default test suite; `pyproject.toml` excludes `ee` and `e2e` markers by default.
- `uv run pytest tests/test_api_assets.py`: run a focused test file while iterating.
- `scripts/acceptance/run.sh`: run acceptance checks when validating broader API behavior.
- `pre-commit run --all-files`: run repository hooks, currently including `gitleaks` secret scanning.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use Python 3.11-compatible code and keep imports/package paths rooted in `src/novelvideo`. Follow the existing style: 4-space indentation, type hints for public interfaces and dataclass/Pydantic models, snake_case for functions and modules, PascalCase for classes, and uppercase names for constants. Keep route handlers thin and move reusable behavior into services, ports, or task runners matching nearby modules. Avoid committing generated media or local runtime state.

For any frontend visual change, read `DESIGN.md` first — it is the source of truth for colors, typography, spacing, radii, elevation, and motion, and mirrors the CSS variables in `frontend/src/index.css`. When those variables change, update `DESIGN.md` in the same commit and keep `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` at 0 errors.

## Testing Guidelines

Tests use `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio` set to auto mode. Name test files `test_*.py` and colocate fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` unless they are narrowly scoped. Mark enterprise-only or full end-to-end tests with `@pytest.mark.ee` or `@pytest.mark.e2e` so default runs stay community-edition friendly. Add focused regression tests for API contracts, task lifecycle changes, storage migrations, and provider error handling.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history uses short conventional prefixes such as `fix:`, `feat(scope):`, `refactor(scope):`, and `chore(scope):`; keep subjects imperative and specific. PRs should describe the user-visible change, list verification commands, link related issues, and include screenshots or sample API output for UI/API contract changes. Note any migration, configuration, model-provider, or compliance impact explicitly.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit provider keys, signed URLs, credentials, or generated secrets. Configure model access through environment variables such as `MODEL_PROVIDER` and `MODEL_API_KEY`. Run the gitleaks pre-commit hook before sharing changes that touch configuration, provisioning, backup, or gateway code.
