# Installation Guide

> Set up the runtime environment for DashBox CE on macOS / Windows / Linux. If you just want the fastest path to running it, go straight to [Quickstart](quickstart.md); this guide covers per-platform prerequisites and the two installation methods (Docker and local development).

DashBox CE is a single-machine service that needs **no PostgreSQL / Redis**. By default Docker brings up `api` + `web`, and models are served through the DashBox official gateway RelayClaw; nothing runs models on your machine, so an ordinary machine is enough. If you want to self-host a fully local gateway, use `docker-compose.selfhosted.yml`.

## Pick one of two installation methods

| Method | Best for | Prerequisites |
|---|---|---|
| **Docker (recommended)** | Deployment, trials, production self-hosting | Just Docker; ffmpeg and friends are in the image |
| **Local development (uv)** | Editing code, debugging | Python 3.11–3.12, uv, ffmpeg (installed yourself) |

> ffmpeg/ffprobe are **system dependencies**; CE does not distribute their binaries (see [ADR-0002](../../adr/0002-ffmpeg-system-dependency.md) for the reasoning). The Docker image already bundles them; for local development you install them yourself — see the [ffmpeg guide](../guides/ffmpeg.md).

---

## A. Docker (recommended)

Prerequisites: Docker + `docker compose`.

| Platform | Install |
|---|---|
| **macOS** | [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (works on both Apple Silicon and Intel) |
| **Windows** | Docker Desktop with the **WSL2** backend enabled (Settings → General → Use WSL2) |
| **Linux** | Docker Engine + `docker-compose-plugin` (from your distro's package manager) |

Once installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dramaclaw/dramaclaw.git
cd dramaclaw
cp .env.example .env        # at minimum, change PROMPT_EXPORT_PASSWORD to a non-default value
docker compose up -d --build   # brings up the api / web services
```

After it's up, open **`http://localhost:8080`** in your browser (the app UI); the REST API is at `http://localhost:8780`. Go to Settings → Model Configuration → Official Channel, paste your DC key, save, and you're ready. For the full walkthrough see [Quickstart](quickstart.md); for start/stop/backup see the [Self-Hosting Handbook](../guides/self-hosting.md).

> Windows users should clone and run inside the **WSL2 terminal** (keep it on the Linux filesystem, not under `/mnt/c/...`) to avoid volume-mount performance and line-ending issues.

## B. Local development (uv + Python 3.11–3.12)

### 1. Install prerequisites

| Platform | Python 3.11/3.12 | uv | ffmpeg |
|---|---|---|---|
| **macOS** | `brew install python@3.12` | `brew install uv` | `brew install ffmpeg` |
| **Windows** | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or `winget install Python.Python.3.12` | `winget install astral-sh.uv` | `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg` (or use WSL2 and follow the Linux flow) |
| **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)** | `apt install python3.12` | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` | `apt install ffmpeg` |

> Python must be in the **3.11–3.12** range (`requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.13"`). uv pins dependency versions according to `uv.lock`.

### 2. Install dependencies and start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dramaclaw/dramaclaw.git
cd dramaclaw

uv sync                                  # install dependencies into .venv per uv.lock
cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env     # set the gateway and key

uv run novelvideo api --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8780
```

CE defaults to `ST_EDITION=ce`, no-login single local user, and in-process inline task execution (no Ray/Redis/Celery).

### 3. Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:8780/api/v1/config   # a 200 response means it's working
```

---

## Optional: world features (3DGS / SHARP depth)

Heavy features such as voxel/panorama-to-3D live in the optional `world` extra; they **require a GPU and an extra toolchain** and are not installed by default:

```bash
uv sync --extra world                       # installs torch / ml-sharp / da2 and others
npm install -g @playcanvas/splat-transform  # PLY→SOG compression tool
```

On the Docker side, build with `--build-arg INSTALL_WORLD=1`. The slim base is CPU-only; GPU acceleration needs a CUDA base + nvidia runtime. Model weights are downloaded automatically at runtime, not baked into the image.

> If you're not doing any 3D/voxel workflows, you can ignore this section; plain text→finished video doesn't need it.
